matasano
========

Code &amp; solutions for the matasano crypto challenge (http://cryptopals.com).

Be warned: this code is _VERY_ hacky!

Code Structure:

    include/   - contains header files possibly used across multiple sets
    src/       - contains src files possibly used across multiple sets
    setX/      - contains files specific for the particular set
    Makefile   - Makefile used to build all or individual sets
    README.md  - this text

Progress:

    *** Set 1 ***
     Challenge 1 .. 8 [done]

    *** Set 2 ***
     Challenge 1 .. 5 [done]
     Challenge 6   [working]

How to use:

    $ make
    $ cd setX; ./main.out

Now watch the show and have fun!
