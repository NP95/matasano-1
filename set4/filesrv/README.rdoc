== README

The 'filesrv' http file server is needed for challenges 31 and 32 for
set 4.
In order to start the server on localhost, port 3000 run:

$ bin/rails server

Now you can start 'main.out' in set4 sub-directory, which will perform
the SHA1-HMAC timing attacks against the insecure compare of the file
server application.

The server code is located in 'app/controllers/file_controller.rb'.
