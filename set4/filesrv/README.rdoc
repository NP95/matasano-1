The 'websrv' emulated http file server is needed for challenges 31 and 32,
set 4.
In order to start the server on localhost, port 3000 run:

$ ruby ./websrv.py

Now you can start 'main.out' in set4 sub-directory, which will perform
the SHA1-HMAC timing attacks against the insecure compare of the file
server application.
